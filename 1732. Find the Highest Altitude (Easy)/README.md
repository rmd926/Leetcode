# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude (Easy)

## Problem
A biker is going on a road trip that consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes, starting at point `0` with an altitude of `0`. You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n`, where `gain[i]` represents the net gain in altitude between point `i` and point `i + 1` for all `0 <= i < n`. Return the highest altitude reached at any point during the trip.

## Examples
**Example 1:**  
Input: `gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: The altitudes are `[0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]`, and the highest altitude is `1`.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation: The altitudes are `[0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]`, and the highest altitude is `0`.

## Constraints
- `n == gain.length`  
- `1 <= n <= 100`  
- `-100 <= gain[i] <= 100`
