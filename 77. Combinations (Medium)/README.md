# 77. Combinations (Medium)

## Problem Description
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range `[1, n]`.

You may return the answer in any order.

A combination is **unordered**, meaning `[1,2]` and `[2,1]` are considered the same combination.

**Input:** `n = 1`, `k = 1`  
**Output:** `[[1]]`

**Explanation:**  
There is `1 choose 1 = 1` total combination.
