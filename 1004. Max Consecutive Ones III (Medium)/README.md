# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III (Medium)

## Question

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0`s.

> ### Example 1:
>
> * Input: `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]`, `k = 2`
> * Output: `6`
> * Explanation: We can flip at most two `0`s into `1`s. The longest subarray has length `6`.

> ### Example 2:
>
> * Input: `nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]`, `k = 3`
> * Output: `10`
> * Explanation: We can flip at most three `0`s into `1`s. The longest subarray has length `10`.

## Constraints:

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
* `0 <= k <= nums.length`
