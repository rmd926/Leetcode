# 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II (Easy)

## Problem Description
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their **intersection**.

Each element in the result:
- must appear **as many times as it shows in both arrays**, and
- may be returned in **any order**.

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`nums1 = [1,2,2,1]`, `nums2 = [2,2]`  

**Output:**  
`[2,2]`

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`nums1 = [4,9,5]`, `nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]`  

**Output:**  
`[4,9]`  

**Explanation:**  
`[9,4]` is also an accepted output.

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

---

## Follow Up

- **If the arrays are already sorted**, how would you optimize your algorithm?
- **If `nums1` is much smaller than `nums2`**, which algorithm would be more efficient?
- **If elements of `nums2` are stored on disk** and memory is limited so that you cannot load all elements into memory at once, how would you solve the problem?
