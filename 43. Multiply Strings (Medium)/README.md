# 43. Multiply Strings (Medium)

## Problem Description
You are given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, where each number is represented as a string.

Return the **product** of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

### Note
- You **must not** use any built-in `BigInteger` library.
- You **must not** convert the input strings directly to integers.

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** `num1 = "2"`, `num2 = "3"`  
**Output:** `"6"`

### Example 2
**Input:** `num1 = "123"`, `num2 = "456"`  
**Output:** `"56088"`

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
- `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only
- `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zeros, except the number `0` itself
