## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** `n = 12`  
**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:**  
`
12 = 4 + 4 + 4
`
So the minimum number of perfect squares is `3`.

---

### Example 2
**Input:** `n = 13`  
**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:**  
`
13 = 4 + 9
`
So the minimum number of perfect squares is `2`.

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
