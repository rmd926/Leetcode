# 64. Minimum Path Sum (Medium)

## Problem

Given an `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from the top left to the bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

You can only move:

- **right**
- **down**

at any point in time.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]`  
**Output:** `7`  

**Explanation:**  
Because the path `1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1` minimizes the sum.

### Example 2

**Input:** `grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]`  
**Output:** `12`

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200`
