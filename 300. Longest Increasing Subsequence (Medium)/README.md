# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
```

**Explanation:**

```text
The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

---

## Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

---

## Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

---

## Constraints

```text
1 <= nums.length <= 2500
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
```

---

## Follow Up

Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log n)` time complexity?
