# 234. Palindrome Linked List (Easy)

## Problem Description
Given the head of a singly linked list, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

A linked list is a **palindrome** if the sequence of node values reads the same forward and backward.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** `head = [1,2,2,1]`  
**Output:** `true`

### Example 2
**Input:** `head = [1,2]`  
**Output:** `false`

---

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`

---

## Follow Up
Could you solve it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` extra space?
